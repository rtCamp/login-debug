# login-debug

Facing issues to maintain the login of WordPress, install this plugin to log all the scenarios
which may lead to login failure.

Requires `WP_DEBUG` and `WP_DEBUG_LOG` to be set `true` in _wp-config.php_ file.

You can install the plugin as a normal plugin or else just drop the `login-debug.php` file directly
into the mu-plugins directory.
